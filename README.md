![alternative text](img/readme_image.jpg)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective

HR Tool Demo is a small web application (built with Streamlit) for HR data analysis and simple employee management. The idea is to demonstrate how modern AI coding tools can accelerate software development. The project uses a synthesized Swiss HR dataset and showcases interactive visualizations and form-based data entry with no direct coding knowledge.
